## Part 1:  The 2021 Puzzle
Objective.  Use A* search to find sequence of moves that gets puzzle back in order.   
(baseline:  solve board1.txt in 11 moves found in less than 15 mins)

__Question 1:__ What is the branching factor of the search tree?  
24?  (5+5+2) axes of motion * 2 directions each

__Question 2:__ If the solution can be reached in 7 moves, about how many states would we need to explore before we found it if we used BFS instead of A* search?  (a rough answer is fine)

__Formulating the search problem__ 
* abstraction
    * state space
    * successor function
    * edge weights
    * goal state
    * heuristic functions (admissible? consistent? accurate? easy to compute?)  
* data structures

__How search algorithm works__  


__Discussion__
* challenges 
* assumptions
* simplifications
*  decisions made



## Part 2:  Road Trip!!!

Objective:  use A* search to find driving directions between two cities and cost function given by the user.  
Bonus points for finding shortest route that passes through at least one city in each 48 contiguous states.

* abstraction
    * state space

* data structures

## Part 3:  Choosing Teams

Objective:  Assign students to teams that minimizes total amount of work for instructors
Multiple solutions allowed.  program can start with an approximate answer while continuing to look for better ones
